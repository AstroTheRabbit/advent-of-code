My solutions to some of the puzzles hosted during the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) (AoC):
- Solutions are sorted by year, then day (e.g "src/y2024/d2.rs").
- Each "d*.rs" file contains a `pub fn solve_pt1()` and `pub fn solve_pt2()`, which are the main function for the respective parts of each day's puzzle.
- Self-imposed challenge: no crates are used other than that of the standard library, e.g. no using the [regex](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/) crate make some of the puzzles *significantly* easier.
